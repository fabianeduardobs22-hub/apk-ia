# SENTINEL X DEFENSE SUITE — Comparative Defensive Analysis

## Scope
This document compares SENTINEL X against common **public categories** seen in advanced SOC tooling ecosystems (packet analyzers, NSM stacks, SIEM pipelines, and forensic suites).

> Legal and ethical boundary: this project is strictly defensive. No offensive capability is included.

## Comparison dimensions

1. **Real-time network visibility**
2. **Detection quality (rule + behavior)**
3. **Forensic integrity and traceability**
4. **Operator UX and triage speed**
5. **Deployment portability on Linux**
6. **Secure-by-design runtime model**

## Improvements added in this iteration

- SOC-like GUI with precision text rendering and deterministic panel layout.
- Live protocol activity bars in textual form for low-overhead observability.
- Dynamic topology text panel to quickly identify high-activity edges.
- Defensive benchmark tab that tracks SENTINEL capability vs public reference categories.
- Root/capabilities requirement only for live capture; replay/offline preserved for least-privilege workflows.

## Outcome

SENTINEL X now provides a stronger unified operator experience for:
- live triage,
- forensic context preservation,
- explainable risk summary,
- and safer operational boundaries.
